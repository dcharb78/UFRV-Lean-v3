UFRF Moonshine Parametric Layer - B₂ invariance and j-coefficient parameterization.

This file provides a Params-aware wrapper around the Monster Moonshine coefficients.
It proves that jCoeff and B2 are independent of which Params instance you use,
once the axioms hold (via params_unique).

This integrates proven formalizations from UFRF-MonsterMoonshinev1, adapted to the modular v3 structure.

Key theorems:
- `jCoeff_param_invariant`: j-coefficients are independent of Params choice
- `B2_param_invariant`: B₂ constant is independent of Params choice
- `B2_for_all_params`: B₂ = 196884 * 169 / (744 * 60) for any admissible Params
